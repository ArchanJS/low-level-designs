| `chess`             | A modular chess game engine handling piece movement, board state, and special rules like **castling**, **en passant**, and **checkmate** detection. |
| `directionapp`      | Demonstrates the **Strategy Pattern** for selecting travel modes (Car, Walk, etc.). |
| `elevatorsystem`    | Elevator system simulation including panels, floors, car movement, and direction handling. |
| `hashmap`           | Custom implementation of a basic HashMap including hash function and collision resolution. |
| `library`           | Library management system supporting cataloging, lending, fines, and notifications. |
| `parser`            | Implements the **Template Method Pattern** to parse different file types (CSV, JSON). |
| `payment`           | Abstract payment framework including UPI, credit and debit card transactions. |
| `paymentsystem`     | A **Strategy Pattern** based payment selection mechanism. |
| `pubsub`            | Basic **Publisher-Subscriber** model for event broadcasting. |
| `ticket-booking`    | A theater ticket booking system with seat types, payments, and user management. |
| `undoredo`          | A simple text editor with **Memento Pattern** for undo and redo actions. |
| `updatetext`        | Uses the **Command Pattern** to apply formatting actions (Bold, Italic) on text. |
| `vendingmachine`    | Functional vending machine using the **State Pattern** to manage inventory and user actions. |
| `weatherstation`    | Implements the **Observer Pattern** for updating displays based on weather changes. |
